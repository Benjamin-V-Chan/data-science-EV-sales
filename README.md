# data-science-EV-sales

## Project Overview

This project performs a comprehensive data science workflow on electric vehicle (EV) sales and adoption data. It includes preprocessing, feature engineering, exploratory data analysis, market segmentation, forecasting, and reporting. The objective is to derive insights for business strategy, identify key market segments, and predict future EV sales using machine learning models.
